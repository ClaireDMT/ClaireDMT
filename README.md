## Hi there, I am Claire :wave:

I am a freelancer developer based in Berlin, Germany.  
I work with Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, Gatsby, and Jekyll.  
I teach programming at [Le Wagon](https://github.com/lewagon)

🪄 I am currently working on diverse [projects](https://www.clairedemont.com/#portfolio). <---- If you are curious  

📫 You can reach me at <claire.edith.demont@gmail.com>.

👩‍💻 Pronouns: She/Her
🇩🇪 I am learning German (B2 ongoing) 
🐧 I am enrolled in a Linux certification through the Linux Foundation.
⚡ Fun fact: I have over at least 40 plants (counter has stopped...) 🪴.

In my free time you will find me either hiking :mountain:, at the movies, swimming in one of many Berlin's lake 🏊‍♀️, or cooking a 3h Ottolenghi's recipe (yes, it's a cult).
