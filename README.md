## Hi there ,I am Claire :wave:

I am a freelancer developer based in Berlin, Germany.
I work with Ruby, Rails, JS, React, Gatsby/Jekyll. I have a new obsession for database optimization... :elephant: 
:woman-cartwheeling:

I like trekking & yoga for the body, and old movies or going to exhibitions for new discoveries. :movie_camera: 
Ocasionally knitt, buy too many plants or game a little bit. :potted_plant:
